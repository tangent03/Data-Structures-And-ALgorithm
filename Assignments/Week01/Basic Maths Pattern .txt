Basic Maths Pattern 

1. For the Reverse Number Problem we have to keep in Mind about the range
   - Given Number should Not Be LESS THAN EQUAL TO INT_MIN 
   - in the loop Reversed Number should not be Greater Than INT_MAX / 10


2. Internal Sorting Function Takes O(n Log n) Time Complexity

3. Ordered Map Complexity in Best , Average , Worst is O(LogN) (Storing and fetching)

4.in Unordered Map The Time Complexity in Best  Scenario is O(1) (storing and fetching) and in Worst - O(N)
	- So first use Unordered map and if TLE Comes Due To Collisions than use Ordered Map
